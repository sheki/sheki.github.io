## What is it?
A **Think Vacation** a good amount of time just thinking without any distractions.
This is not a new concept, a lot of people in the past used to retreat to their
cabins/summer homes etc to think and catch a break. We in the modern world do
not have the luxury to do it - due to lack of time/money, the distracting phone
or due amazing restaurants and signs available to us during our real vacations.

A Think-Vacation is an experiment to go back to a vacation from all the distraction
So that you can spend time thinking.

## What do I think about?
Deep Thinking is a habit, and it needs to be cultivated by doing work that is hard
for your brain. A think-vacation will not make you a deep thinker over night.
But  its a start. You can think about anything - big or small.
Some examples to get you churning:

* How to upend capitalism?
* Are burritos sandwiches?
* What is the plan to write that book you have in your mind?
* How do you want your career to look like?

## How does this work in a group?

Thinking is not a group activity. The point of group is to provide you with support,
encouragement and periodic comic relief. I am not an hermit, and neither are you.
We cannot think for long periods without getting bored. The group will steer you back.

## How do I not get distracted?

Glad you asked. At this **Think Vacation** you will not be allowed to use the
internet or the phone. All phones will be locked up in a car for the duration
of the stay.  You can bring your laptop if you want to use it for a project.
Please install the required software before hand.
Getting a notebook and pen is highly encouraged. You cannot smoke intoxicants
like Marijuana. Alcohol consumption is discouraged - but maybe a couple of beers
or a glass of wine will get your inhibitions loosened.
Board-games are discouraged, but left to your judgement.

## What about books?
Books are considered a form of entertainment, and are discouraged. But the final decision
on getting a book lies upon you. A book may stir some thoughts up. You can get your
coloring books and mandala stuff as they stimulate thinking.
Project based books are a good fit for a Think Vacation. Some examples:

* Roadmap: The Get-It-Together Guide for Figuring Out What to Do with Your Life

* The Maeve Binchy Writers' Club [link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0752883070?tag=fivboo-20)

## Logistics
This is some weekend in April. This Vacation shall be for 3 Days. Fri-Sat-Sun.
Rough schedule looks like reach the place at 12PM on
Friday and leave it by 12PM on Sunday. We shall load up on food,
perhaps even cook something beforehand. You are encouraged to bring lots of food.
Logistics will be organized by me (sheki). So hopefully you
do not have to do a lot. Just show up.

## What if I get bored?
You can go out, go for a run, check out the nature (depending on the location).
Okay maybe you can bring some cards/dominoes - light weight games.

## Sounds good, take my money
I am looking for 6 people to sign up. You pay 100$ as a deposit and the rest of
the amount based on the cabin etc at a later date. If I do not find 6 people,
you get your money back.
