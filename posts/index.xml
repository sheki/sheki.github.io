      <description>What is it? A Think Vacation a good amount of time just thinking without any distractions. This is not a new concept, a lot of people in the past used to retreat to their cabins/summer homes etc to think and catch a break. We in the modern world do not have the luxury to do it - due to lack of time/money, the distracting phone or due amazing restaurants and signs available to us during our real vacations.</description>

      <description>Taylor: Why is that so that when you add more workers to a construction project, it speeds things up but adding more programmers to a Software project does not.
BJ: Buildings have very well specified blue-prints. In software if you have good blue-prints the job is already done.</description>
